# Pipes-Concurrency

`pipes-concurrency` provides an actor-like concurrency system that interfaces
with
[the `pipes` library](https://github.com/Gabriella439/Haskell-Pipes-Library).

## Quick start

* Install the [Haskell Platform](http://www.haskell.org/platform/)
* `cabal install pipes-concurrency`

The official tutorial is on
[Hackage](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/pipes-concurrency).

## Features

* *Simple API*: Use only five functions

* *Deadlock Safety*: Automatically avoid concurrency deadlocks

* *Flexibility*: Build many-to-many and cyclic communication topologies

* *Dynamic Graphs*: Add or remove readers and writers at any time

## Outline

`pipes-concurrency` just really, really useful for concurrency, even if you
don't use `pipes` at all.  However, the most common applications are merging
asynchronous events and broadcasting to multiple outputs.

## Development Status

`pipes-concurrency` is relatively stable.  At this point I am just adding
of 2013 then the library will be officially stabilized.

## Community Resources

Use the same resources as the core `pipes` library to learn more, contribute, or
request help:

* [Haskell wiki page](http://www.haskell.org/haskellwiki/Pipes)

* [Mailing list](mailto:haskell-pipes@googlegroups.com) ([Google Group](https://groups.google.com/forum/?fromgroups#!forum/haskell-pipes))

## How to contribute

* Build derived libraries

* Write `pipes-concurrency` tutorials
